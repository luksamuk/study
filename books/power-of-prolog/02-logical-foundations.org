Logic is a very broad topic.

Logic  is concerned  with  the properties  of,  and relations  between
syntax, semantics

- Syntax (formulae, sentences...)
- Semantics (truth, validity, semantic consequences...)
- Inferences (proofs, theorems, soundness, completeness...)


** Example 1.

Statement *A*: /"It is an apple"/.
Statement *B*: /"It is a banana."/

\begin{equation*}
\frac{\,A \lor B \qquad \lnot A\,}{B}
\end{equation*}

Notation:

\begin{equation*}
\frac{\,\textrm{premises}\,}{\,\textrm{conclusion}\,}
\end{equation*}

The reasoning doesn't  depend on the content  of *A* and *B*.  Not even on
the /truth/ of  those premises. Deduction is done from  the /structure/ of
the statements.

Name of the rule: /disjunctive syllogism/ or /modus tollendo ponens/.

Sequent notation: $A \lor B,\, \lnot A \vdash B$
