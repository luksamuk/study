#+title: Decoding Primitive Files
#+startup: content

* Intro to our Final Project

Let's tackle something bigger.

We're gonna reuse assets from the game Wipeout.

The Wipeout CD-ROM has several tracks, plus the directories ~COMMON~ and ~SFX~.

Inside ~COMMON~, we're going to find the files ~ALLSH.PRM~ and ~ALLSH.CMP~.

~ALLSH.PRM~ is  a binary file containing  the *primitives for all  ships*. So it
contains vertices, face  indices, triangles, quads, colors, UV  coords, CLUT and
TPAGE info, etc.

We'll begin by analyzing the structure of this file and then we can move forward
from there.

* Importing Project Assets

* PRM File Layout

* Reading Object Name from PRM File

* Reading Vertices from PRM File

* Handling Different Primitive Types

* Reading Primitives from PRM File

* Drawing Flat-Shaded Object Faces

* Using sizeof with Variable Name

* Reverse Engineering Wipeout Files
