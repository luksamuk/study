* Moving from MIPS Assembly to C

We're going  to start working  with the  C language for  PlayStation development
now.

There are a few unanswered questions:

- How do we read data from the CD-ROM?
- How to create animations and use double-buffering?
- How to read input from the joystick?
- Can we use floating-point numbers?
- How to access the GTE coprocessor?

These  questions  can now  be  more  easily  answered  using the  C  programming
language.

* Linux install

On Ubuntu:

#+begin_src bash
sudo apt install gcc-mipsel-linux-gnu g++-mipsel-linux-gnu binutils-mipsel-linux-gnu
#+end_src

On Arch Linux and derivatives, install from AUR:

#+begin_src bash
yay -S cross-mipsel-linux-gnu-binutils cross-mipsel-linux-gnu-gcc
#+end_src

Download PsyQ SDK:

#+begin_src bash
cd dev/
wget http://psx.arthus.net/sdk/Psy-Q/psyq-4.7-converted-full.7z
7z x psyq-4.7-converted-full.7z -o./psyq
#+end_src

If you haven't already, download the git submodule on ~thirdparty/nugget/~:

#+begin_src bash
cd /repository/root/dir
git submodule update --init
#+end_src
